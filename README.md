## Supporting code for 'A comparative analysis of planarian genomes reveals regulatory conservation in the face of rapid structural divergence'
Archived first release: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/833540152.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13123038)

This project compares the genomes of *S. Mediterranea* (SM), *S. Polychroa* (SP), *S. Lugubris* (SL) and *S. Nova* (SN) with a special focus on regulatory regions identified by ATACseq and ChIPseq. 
Furthermore, several approaches have been used for synteny analysis between *Schmidtea* and other flatworm genomes and in relation to Metazoan ancestral linkage groups. 

The project includes the original code and commands generated for this project.
Note that it is not intended to be run automatically but it requires manual execution and modifications of variables to suite your system.

## Genome annotation pipeline

The genome annotation pipline is in the `ONTCompFlatwormGenomics` directory.
